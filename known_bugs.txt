AA list of known bugs etc.

--Open editor -> load level -> click on an object -> object is not dropped if the user doesn't move mouse

--Level description can overflow if the text is too long.

--Add a delay on winning. For example, the example animation doesn't play now since winning is instant.

--Is not near point causes segfault when saving. (tolerance seems to be uninitialised when used in getTolerance()).

--Resize a win condition box so that the cursor ends up in the toolbox and it becomes difficult to resize again.

--Seesaw is not mirrored when loaded from a file.



--SFML seems to leak some memory. It is a constant sized chunk and does not grow over time.
	Anton: I heard the same thing from a friend that attended the course last year. SFML does indeed leak memory
